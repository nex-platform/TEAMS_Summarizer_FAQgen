12:04 Neerav ABC Yes. I can see the devices are up from the last 7 minutes; both are coming up, they've made the adjacency, and now most of the tunnels are up.

16:34 Aryan Praveen, can you confirm when the site went down?

16:45 Praveen Stand by. I'll put it in the chat.

17:13 Aryan This is 2:42, that is Eastern Time, correct.

17:57 Praveen Yes, I just put the GMT in the chat.

18:00 Praveen Shared the following in the chat: It started at 2:42 PM local time. Devices started to ping at 3:29 PM.

18:01 Aryan So I'll put this as a start time.

18:33 Praveen Can you check all of the devices on site, Neerav? Make sure they all came up.

18:46 Neerav ABC Yes, Bol, I'm just checking on them.

18:52 Praveen Thank you.

19:56 Aryan So Praveen, you're confirming that at 3:29 PM, the devices started working. Are the users at the site able to log in or use their operations?

20:09 Praveen I'll have to check in with them. I haven't talked to the end users. I've been looking at the network, but let me try to reach out to a couple of guys.

20:17 Aryan Yeah.

22:04 Praveen Are checking all their services and stuff, so just stand by.

22:10 Goutham Is the site having just one power source, or are the devices that went down connected to one power source? Can we also check that in parallel?

22:34 Praveen We'll have to check that. We'll have to ask them afterwards. That should be part of the problem ticket. When the problem ticket gets brought up, we should have them check. It was a major issue from the substation that caused the power to be down.

22:43 Goutham OK.

22:51 Praveen But we have to check on the demo not there. We'll have to ask them, but that should be part of the problem ticket. When a problem ticket gets created.

22:59 Goutham Got it. Praveen, by any chance do you have the count of users impacted on the particular site?

27:23 Praveen I do not know.

27:26 Goutham OK.

28:20 Neerav ABC I have seen multiple switches and I can see all of them were power rebooted, but now they are reachable. Some of them are left and taking the rest of the switches and will update soon.

28:36 Goutham Thanks, Neerav.
